Child neglect is the failure of the parent or care-giver to provide the child with adequate care and supervision. Physical abuse, sometimes referred to as the battered child syndrome, may involve physical violence, systematic poisoning, or other non-accidental injuries. Sexual abuse usually involves genital contact and may range in severity from fondling to forcible rape with physical injury. Child pornography and enforced prostitution are included. Psychological abuse refers to deliberate and repetitive subjection of a child to fear, rejection, humiliation, loneliness, and other painful psychological states.  </p>

A defect in any one of these areas can be either innate or acquired. A characteristic defect state of the personality, ranging in its manifestations from loss of intellectual and emotional vigour and mild eccentricities of behaviour to autistic withdrawal or affective blunting, has been held by Kraepelin (1856-1926) and Eugen Bleuler (1857-1939) to be a hallmark of the outcome of schizophrenic illnesses, in contrast to manic-depressive psychosis.   </p>

Primary delusions are essentially incomprehensible in terms of the individual’s life history and personality; secondary delusions are psychologically com­ prehensible and arise from morbid and other states of mind, e.g. affective disorder or suspicion. A distinction was made, by Birnbaum in 1908 and Jaspers in 1913, between delusion proper and delusion-like ideas; the latter are merely mistaken judgements held with exaggerated tenacity.  </p>

</h5>
                                <p>Psychopathological or neurological manifestations of a dimi­nution or loss of normal function resulting from a lesion in the central nervous system. The concept derives from the dissolution theory of Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), which postulated a dual effect of cerebral lesions: deficits directly due to the lesion, and positive phenomena arising secondarily as ontogenically lower levels are released from the control of the superior centre. This view has had repercussions in psychiatry, notably in the descriptive psychopathol­ogy of schizophrenia. Symptoms usually referred to as negative include poverty of speech, impairment of attention, affective blunting, apathy, and social withdrawal. However, there is no general agreement on the nature and the assessment of the negative symptoms, and little is known about their pathophysiological basis in schizophrenia.</p>

                                <p>A disorder characterized in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are inappropriate or blunted. Clear consciousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained, although certain cognitive deficits may evolve in the course of time. The disturbance involves the most basic functions that give the normal person a feeling of individuality, uniqueness, and self-direction. The most intimate thoughts, feelings, and acts are often felt to be known or shared by others, and explanatory delusions may develop, to the effect that natural or supernatural forces are at work to influence the afflicted individual’s thoughts and actions in ways that are often bizarre. Although no strictly pathognomonic symptoms can be identified, the most important psychopathological phe­nomena include thought echo, thought insertion or withdrawal, thought broadcasting, delusional perception, and delusions of control, influence or passivity, hallucinatory voices commenting on or discussing the patient in the third person, disorders in the train of thought, catatonia, and negative symptoms. The course of schizophrenia can be continuous, or episodic with progressive or stable deficit following the episodes, or consist of one or more episodes with complete remissions.

Individual vulnerability and coping capacity play a role in the occurrence and severity of acute stress reactions.

This state may be followed either by further withdrawal from the surrounding situation (to the extent of a dissociative stupor), or by agitation and over-activity (flight reaction or fugue). Autonomic signs of panic anxiety (tachycardia, sweating, flushing) are commonly present. The symptoms usually appear within minutes of the impact of the stressful stimulus or event, and disappear within 2-3 days (often within hours).

</h5>
                                <p>Inadequate vitamin B12, often a nutritional deficiency secondary to insufficient absorption of the vitamin from the ileum in individuals with long-standing gastrointestinal disease. A frequent result is subacute degeneration of the spinal cord, optic nerves, cerebral white matter, and peripheral nerves. Spinal cord involvement is manifested as combined system disease, characterized by symmetrical progressive paraesthesias of the feet or hands (numbness, tingling, burning, etc.), followed by unsteadiness of gait and finally spasticity, ataxia, and paraplegia. Psychological symptoms include apathy, irritability, suspiciousness, and, with progression, confusion and dementia.

                                <p>The act of giving utterance, of making sounds or words, used most often to refer to the panicky scream that typically signals the onset of an episode of sleep terror, or to the involuntary repetition of a vowel, word, or phrase that occurs as a characteristic element in some types of focal epilepsy. Vocalization is also used to refer to the sounds made by infants before they acquire regular speech.

</h5>
                                <p>Any mental or behavioural disorder due to the use of volatile solvents. When inhaled, volatile solvents (also called inhalants) such as glue, aerosol paints, industrial solvents, lacquer thinners, gasoline, and cleaning fluids produce altered states of consciousness. In addition, some solvents are directly toxic to the liver, kidney, or heart, and some produce peripheral neuropathy or progressive brain degeneration. The user typically soaks a rag with inhalant and places it over the mouth and nose, or puts the inhalant in a paper or plastic bag which is then put over the face (inducing anoxia as well as intoxication). Signs of intoxication include belligerence, assaultiveness, lethargy, psychomotor retardation, euphoria, im­paired judgement, dizziness, nystagmus, blurred vision or diplopia, slurred speech, tremors, unsteady gait, hyperreflexia, muscle weakness, stupor, or coma.

</h5>
                                <p>An inability to comprehend spoken or written language, and in particular to understand or report spoken language and to name objects or qualities. Reading and writing are secondarily impaired. The lesion, generally vascular, is usually in the association cortex of the first temporal convolution of the dominant hemisphere. In children, this impairment may occur as a specific developmental disorder

</h5>
                                <p>An acute, life-threatening, neurological syndrome (de­scribed as polioencephalitis haemorrhagica superior in 1881) consisting of confusion, apathy, dullness, a dreamy delirium, palsies of the ocular muscles and of gaze (due to lesions in the nuclei of cranial nerves Ill and VI), nystagmus and · disturbances in equilibrium (due to lesions in the vestibular nuclei), and ataxia (due to lesions in the cerebellar cortex). Its most common cause in industrialized countries is thiamine deficiency associated with alcoholism. If not treated immediately with replacement therapy, the patient is likely to progress into Korsakov psychosis (also known as Wernicke-Korsakov psychosis or syndrome, and as alcohol amnestic disorder}: severe anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia, and sometimes confabulation.

                                <p>A group of symptoms of variable clustering and degree of severity occurring on absolute or relative withdrawal of a substance after persistent use of that substance. The onset and course are time-limited and are related to the type of substance and dose being used immediately before cessation or reduction of use. The withdrawal state may be complicated by convulsions or delirium.

In expressive language disorder, impairment of word fluency and output may be manifested in speech that is halting and hesitant, with a restricted vocabulary and excessive use of generalizations; sentences may be abnormally short or telegrammatic because of omission of conjunctions and prepositions.
